# flutter_camera_access

## steps to integrate camera in your flutter app
 - Add the following dependencies 
 ```
    path_provider: any
    camera: any
    path: any
 ```
 - Now ensure the current cameras initialization 
      ` widgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized `
      
 - check for the list of cameras available 
       -- `final cameras= new availableCameras()`
       -- `final firstCamera= cameras.first;`
 - creat a camera controller and future initization controller
 - update all controller in initStater()
 - user futureBuilder to show camera using camerapreview() only if available otherwise use progress indicator 
 - Now capture image using take picture function and save it on a temporary path using a path_provider plugin
